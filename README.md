# STACUP-2023

This project is a result of the workshop "Statistical Techniques in Cosmology and Astrophysics using Python" (STACUP 2023), held at the Department of Physics, Bharathidashan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India for a period of 5 days, starting from 16th October upto 20th October. It focussed on understanding the cosmology and expansion of Universe, coupling this knowledge with Bayesian Statistics and estimating parameters of various cosmological models using the Hubble observations and the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm in Python.
